#  Discover

We start with a discovery phase in which we understand the **requirements** and problems client wants to solve. We provide our expert opinions and act as problem solvers. 

# Plan

When client gets **onboard** with us, we do proper planning and estimation  sessions. We provide varied options to clients based on work they want us to implement.

# Design 

We pen down the approach we are going to follow for **problem solving.** It helps clients to visualise the end results early.

# Implement

Implementation of provided solution is done in **incremental way**, keeping in essence of the agile methodology. Frequent **feedback sessions** are executed with client to polish the end product nicely

# Support

After completion of project we don't leave the clients. We **support continuously** for helping them if they face any issues or if they want new changes. 




# Plans

We have some plans which client can choose from
